description: "I participated in a panel discussion with Scott Kennedy, Suzanne McBride, Kent Redfield, Eric van Zanten and Miriam Marks on campaign disclosure in Illinois. It was an especially exciting to be on the same panel as Kent, who is one of the leading experts on Illinois campaign disclosure. He actually wrote the book on it: <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Money-Counts-Dominate-Illinois-Politics/dp/0938943197/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1448254982&sr=1-2&refinements=p_27%3AKent+Redfield'>Money Counts: How Dollars Dominate Illinois Politics and What We Can Do About It</a>."
