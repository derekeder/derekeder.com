        <strong>Hi, I'm Derek Eder.</strong>
        I'm an entrepreneur, developer and one of the leaders of the civic technology community in Chicago. During the day, I run <a href='https://datamade.us'>DataMade</a>, a civic technology company. We build open source technology using data to empower journalists, researchers, governments and advocacy organizations.
      </p>

        Demond Drummer and Derek Eder share the story of how community organizers, technologists, and the City of Chicago collaborated to roll out a new program to give local residents ownership of vacant land in their neighborhood and incentivize neighborhood-level investment.

        What's the OpenGov thing all about anyway? In my first ever Pecha Kucha-style talk, I make an attempt to summarize 7 years of Open Government history in 6 minutes and 20 seconds.

        To make Chicagoâ€™s zoning code digestible by humans, we took inspiration from one of our favorite games:
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000'>Sim City 2000</a>.
        Find out how your building is zoned, learn where to locate your business and explore zoning patterns throughout the city.
