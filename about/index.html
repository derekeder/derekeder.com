<h3>My bio: the long version</h3>
<p>Or, my journey in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_technologist">civic tech</a>.</p>
<br /><p class="h4">In the beginning, there was open data</p>
<p>In August 2011, I was working for a dev shop in Chicago called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webitects/">Webitects</a>
  when the City&#39;s recently elected mayor (Rahm
  Emanuel) decided to start releasing some interesting data on the city's <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/">Data
    Portal</a>. At the time, I already had an
  interest in government and technology and had volunteered my tech skills to the Obama campaign in 2008, but this
  data gave me a way to engage with my local government and community that was completely new.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PaulBaker">Paul Baker</a>, my boss at
  Webitects, decided to put a group together &mdash; <a href="https://about.me/pry">Chad Pry</a>, <a
    href="https://www.c82.net/">Nick Rougeux</a>, Ryan Briones and
  me &mdash; to take one of these
  newly released datasets on <a
    href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Ethics/Lobbyist-Data-Lobbyist-Registry-2011/tpf5-fgtw">lobbyist
    disclosures</a> to create our first &quot;civic app&quot; called <a
    href="https://www.chicagolobbyists.org/">Chicago Lobbyists</a>.</p>

<p>The app, which I like to describe as a &quot;Facebook for lobbyists,&quot; allows you to see who the
  top paid lobbyists are, who&#39;s hiring them, and who in government they are lobbying. Through this app, this raw,
  open data was made accessible to average citizens (like ourselves) in a way that was easy to understand and
  delightful to interact with. The response from <a
    href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2011/august_2011/mayor_emanuel_announcesnewlobbyistdatathatprovidesclearconnectio.html">the
    City</a>, <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2012/01/31/chicago-data-apps">local
    press</a> and tech
    community was immediate and positive.</p>
    
    <br /><p class="h4">Co-founding Open City</p>
<p>At this point, I was hooked on making civic apps. I continued collaborating with Paul, Nick, and Chad
  to build new apps with other available datasets like <a href="https://chicagobuildings.org/">ChicagoBuildings.org</a>,
  which tracks vacant and abandoned
  buildings in Chicago, and <a href="https://lookatcook.org/">Look at Cook</a>, a visualization for
  exploring Cook County's budget over time.</p>

<p>Through the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/opengovchicago/">OpenGov Chicago(-land) Meetup</a> run
  by <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/">Dan X. O'Neil</a> and <a href="https://about.me/joegermuska">Joe
    Germuska</a>, I met and collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/jpvelez">Juan-Pablo Velez</a> and Forest
  Gregg to
  create <a href="http://clearstreets.org/">ClearStreets</a>, an app to track where snow plows go during a
  snowstorm. This got us our first big exposure in the <a
    href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-01-21/news/ct-talk-snow-tracker-0121-20120121_1_plow-web-page-internet">Chicago
    Tribune</a>.</p>

<p>I eventually found myself among a core group of volunteer developers, designers and policy wonks who
  all shared a common goal: to create apps with open data to improve transparency and understanding of our government.
  We knew we had a great thing going, so in January 2012, we decided to give it a name and call
  ourselves <a href="http://opencityapps.org/">Open City</a>.</p>

  <br /><p class="h4">Chi Hack Night</p>
<p>In order to better facilitate collaboration and get work done outside of our regular 9-to-5 jobs, we
  decided to start meeting regularly every week. Our <a
    href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2012/03/22/the-first-hack-night.html">first
    meeting</a> consisted of Juan-Pablo Velez, <a href="https://srobbin.com/">Scott Robbin</a>, <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaskompare/">Tom Kompare</a> and myself (I gave a <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dg1SN1edTaZE">lightning talk about this
    moment</a> in 2016).</p>

<p>We dubbed this event Open Gov Hack Night (now <a href="https://chihacknight.org/">Chi Hack Night</a>), made it open
  for anyone to attend
  and <a
    href="https://groups.google.com/forum/%23!searchin/opengovchicago/webitects$20derek$20hack/opengovchicago/DFk0EnIOg5g/_faxY1ik8uAJ">publicized
    it</a> on the OpenGov Chicago Google
    Group. The idea of a friendly place to talk about civic tech and get work done was apparently very
    appealing
    to a lot of people. </p>
<p>Over the first few years it grew from 4 to 40 to over 100 weekly attendees - developers,
  designers, researchers, journalists, policy wonks and curious citizens who all want to build or learn about open
  data and civic tech.</p>

  <br /><p class="h4">Starting DataMade, a civic technology company</p>
<p>In the Summer of 2012, I was approached by Dan X. O'Neil, the new Executive Director of
  the <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a>, to work
  on some projects (Connect
    Chicago and <a href="http://chicagoearlylearning.org/">Chicago Early Learning</a>) as a consultant. I had
  already decided to go part-time at Webitects to devote more time to Open City, and it seemed like it was finally
  time to strike out on my own.</p>

<p>I formed my own LLC, called it DataMade (my wife Aya's idea) and got to work. At the same time,
  my collaborations with Forest Gregg continued on projects like <a href="http://cpstiers.opencityapps.org/">CPS
    Tiers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/datamade/dedupe">Dedupe</a> and <a
    href="https://chicago.councilmatic.org/">Councilmatic</a>. In January 2013, Forest joined
  DataMade as a partner.</p>

<p>Over the years DataMade has grown our <a href="https://datamade.us/about-us/index.html">staff</a>, <a
    href="https://datamade.us/our-work/index.html">clients</a> and <a
    href="https://datamade.us/services/index.html">expertise</a>. Our clients include many notable
  universities, nonprofits and municipalities, including the City of Chicago, Los Angeles METRO, Injustice Watch, DePaul University, and Columbia University.
</p>

<br /><p class="h4">Growing up and taking my place as a leader of Chicago's civic tech community</p>
<p>Since my first civic app back in 2011, through persistence and determination, I steadily
  became a leader in the open government and civic tech movements in Chicago. </p>

<p>Many of the applications, approaches and ideas we championed have spread to cultural institutions like
  the Chicago Architecture Foundation via their <a href="http://bigdata.architecture.org/">City of Big Data Exhibit</a>,
  to academia via programs like
  the <a href="https://www.datascienceforsocialgood.org/">Eric &amp; Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer
    Fellowship</a>, to the Chicago startup
    scene, and even back to the City of Chicago and their ambitious <a
    href="http://techplan.cityofchicago.org/initiatives-by-strategy/effective-government/initiative-14/">Tech
    Plan</a>.</p>

<p>As the Chicago civic tech community continues to mature and evolve, so have the fledgling
  organizations I have started. Chi Hack Night is now <a
    href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2018/11/09/incorporating-as-a-non-profit.html">incorporated as a non-profit
    organization</a> with an <a
    href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2019/04/11/introducing-the-chi-hack-night-board-of-directors.html">11 member
    board</a>, of which I am now the Board President. DataMade has grown to 6 staff and we have spun out
  one of our data tools, <a href="https://dedupe.io/">Dedupe.io</a>, as its own software as a service company.</p>

<p>I have become one of the most visible people in the Chicago tech scene, appearing frequently on shows
  like <a href="https://news.wttw.com/tags/derek-eder">WTTW's Chicago
    Tonight</a> and participating as a member of both Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi's and
  <a href="https://bettertogetherchicago.com/transition-team/">Chicago Mayor Lori
    Lightfoot's</a> Transition Teams.
</p>

<p>In all of these positions I now hold or have created for myself, I will continue to elevate
  and highlight the work of our community and organizations, and create some more of it myself. I will advocate for
  the ethical and humane use of technology and continue to push for more transparency, accountability and equity in
  Chicago. And now that I am in a position of power and influence, I will use that power to open more doors for those
  who seek to follow the same path I did. </p>

<br /><p class="h4">Additional thanks</p>
<p>No one ever truly makes it on their own. In addition to the people mentioned above, I'd like to thank a few people for helping me get to where I am today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My parents, Bob and Jan Eder - for of course raising me, but also valuing my education and sending me to college debt free. Later in life I now fully appreciate the gift that this was</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gene-adams-854899/">Gene Adams</a>, Vice President of Information Services at the Art Institute of Chicago - for referring me to Webitects to get my first good programming job</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddreifenrath/">Todd Reifenrath</a>, (former) Vice President at Webitects - for being my first good boss and showing me the value of patience, curiosity, and autonomy in a professional setting</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.colum.edu/academics/faculty/suzanne-mcbride">Suzanne McBride</a>, Dean of Graduate Studies at Columbia College Chicago - for seeking me out and paying me to make my first interactive Google map of Tax Increment Finance (TIF) projects</li>
</ul>
