        As of today the mid-term elections are only three months away. Between now and November 4th, campaigns will be frantically raising and spending as much money as they can. While candidates do need to disclose their spending this information isn't that easy to find, and it can be even harder to analyze. Well, that process got a little easier last week with the launch of <a href='http://electionmoney.org'>ElectionMoney.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site collects information on candidates, contributions, spending and more, and makes it free to download. Itâ€™s intended for people who are serious about finding out information about campaign finance, especially journalists, researchers and analysts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joining us to talk about the site are two of its creators, Derek Eder, owner of civic data company DataMade, and David Melton, Executive Director of the nonpartisan Illinois Campaign for Political Reform.
