      When you open your data to the rest of the world, wonderful and unexpected things can happen. Developers build useful tools around them, and everyone benefits. DataMade can help guide you through the process of cleaning up, 
      %a{:href => 'https://github.com/open-city/dedupe/wiki'} de-duplicating 
      and releasing your data to make it easily accessible for developers, all while keeping sensitive information secure.

      %strong Learn to tell stories with open data
      %br
      We live in a time where an unprecedented amount of data is being gathered and published by governments, companies and organizations. DataMade can help you to understand, interpret and tell the stories behind all this open data. Journalists welcome!
