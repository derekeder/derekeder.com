*On June 17 2025, I will be appointed to the [Oak Park Village Board](https://www.oak-park.us/Government/Leadership/Village-Board) as a Trustee. I am assuming the seat that was [recently vacated by Susan Buchanan](https://www.oakpark.com/2025/05/12/susan-buchanan-resigns-from-oak-park-village-board/) and will fulfill the remainder of her term until 2027.*

*This will be a part-time, paid commitment. I will continue my important work as Partner at DataMade and Board Member at Chi Hack Night.*

*This is the speech I will give after being sworn in, introducing myself and sharing my vision for Oak Park. You can tune in at [7pm CT here on the Village website](https://oak-park.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1304262&GUID=4A593326-1B05-4B0C-826F-144402A9CDE9) to watch the appointment and my first Board meeting.*

<hr />

First, many thank-yous are in order. I thank Dr. Susan Buchanan for her many years of service to Oak Park and as a tireless leader for climate action in our Village. 

I thank the Oak Park Climate Action Network (or [OPCAN](https://opcan.org/)) and its many leaders, Laura Derks, Pam Tate, Amy Rosenthal, Cindy Klein-Banai, Macey Majkrzak, Wendy Greenhouse, Nick Bridge, Chris Pinc, Laura Loveless, Manolo Avalos, and Mac Robinet. OPCAN provided my first pathway to meaningfully engage in local Oak Park politics and climate advocacy. 

I would also like to thank President Scaman for her faith in me to assume this great role in public service, and her continued leadership of our Village, and to the Village Board, my new fellow colleagues. 

I commit to serve all 53,000 residents of Oak Park to the best of my ability. I assume this role with humility, and an understanding that there is a great deal for me to learn — about Oak Park’s staff, its policies, its organizations, its businesses, and its people. I intend to learn as quickly as I can, and to apply my own expertise and experiences to discussions and actions at the Village Board table.

For those of you who do not know me, I am Derek Eder, a civic technologist, a climate champion, and a progressive.

**A civic technologist**

I am the founding partner of [DataMade](https://datamade.us), a data and web consultancy for civil society working toward democracy, justice, and equity, and co-founder and President Emeritus of[ Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org), a free, weekly event in Chicago to build, share and learn about civic technology.

I have dedicated the past 15 years of my life to serve the public good through community organizing, policy, data, and technology. I have built and collaborated on dozens of open source civic websites including the [Illinois Solar Map](https://ilsolarmap.com/),[ 2nd City Zoning](https://secondcityzoning.org),[ and Chicago's Million Dollar Blocks](http://chicagosmilliondollarblocks.com/).

I have served on the transition teams for Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, and served as a recurring correspondent on [WTTW’s Chicago Tonight](https://news.wttw.com/tags/derek-eder).

It has been through the lens of technology and data that I have gained a deep and valuable education on civics, government operations, and policy. I believe that technology can be a positive lever for good in our society, as long as it is centered in transparency, democracy, justice and equity. 

**A climate champion**

Three years ago, I joined the Oak Park Climate Action Network (OPCAN), a volunteer group of Oak Parkers working to eliminate our community’s contribution to the global climate crisis through equitable policies and practices. 

Through OPCAN, I have used my technology and organizing skills to help establish the [Climate Coach program](https://opcan.org/climate-coaches), which to date, has provided neighbor-to-neighbor assistance on home electrification and emissions reductions to over 100 Oak Park households. I have also [fully electrified my own home](https://derekeder.com/electrification/), and documented in detail the process, challenges, benefits, and costs.

I am here to continue Susan Buchanan’s climate action leadership at the Village Board. Oak Park is already a leader on climate action, but we still have so far to go. According to our own climate action plan (also known as [Climate Ready Oak Park](https://www.sustainoakpark.com/), or CROP) we have less than 5 years to reduce our climate pollution by 60%. 

We have amazing, dedicated staff and several promising programs, like the [Energy Efficiency and Electrification Grants](https://www.oak-park.us/Services-Parking/Homeowner-Programs/Energy-Efficiency-and-Electrification-Incentive-Programs) and [Building Benchmarking](https://www.oak-park.us/your-government/environmental-sustainability/building-benchmarking), that will help us get there, but we need to move faster. But we must do so equitably, providing grants and education while removing barriers so we can all benefit from the clean energy transition.

As Trustee, I will continue to push for more Sustainability funding, new and expanded electrification programs, and more data to measure our impact and effectiveness.

**A progressive**

I am also a progressive. I believe in using the levers of government to undo institutionalized racism that exists in our policing, education, and housing policies. 

I believe in the need for safe, equitable and accessible biking, walking and transit. 

I believe that Oak Park should continue to be a sanctuary for all people, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or immigration status. 

And I believe that it is the duty of all of us, but especially our leaders, to stand against fascism, racism, xenophobia and oligarchy.

I have been a proud resident of Oak Park since 2018, along with my wonderful partner (and fellow climate advocate) Aya, and two children, one at Lincoln Elementary and one at Brooks Middle School. 

We love Oak Park for its active community, excellent schools, beautiful parks, wonderful facilities and its values and commitment to advancing racial equity and social justice.

As a Village Trustee, I will strive to live up to these values, to plug into the work that is already underway, and to join the movement that continues to guide our Village into a brighter future for all its residents.

Let’s get to work!
