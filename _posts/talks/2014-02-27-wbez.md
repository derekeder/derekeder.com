description: "The public struggles of healthcare.gov have brought unusual attention to the process of how governments choose the companies who provide their technology. Is IT so specialized that the government needs to contract IT companies for their projects? Derek Eder, owner of DataMade, an open data web development consulting company in Chicago, joins us in studio. He's experienced firsthand the difficulty of working through the city's procurement process. Plus, Dan O'Neil, the executive director at Smart Chicago Collaborative and an organizer of the OpenGovChicago meetup, also joins us."
