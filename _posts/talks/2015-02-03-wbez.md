        I talk about <a href='http://clearstreets.org'>ClearStreets.org</a>, a website that tracks where Chicago snow plows have been, how and why we built it, and using open data to investigate how the City responds to snow events.
      </p>

        A few hours after this interview, the Chicago Sun-Times published this story, which I helped investigate: <a href='http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/7/71/341993/snowplows-hit-ald-burkes-street-five-times'>The snowplows hit Ald. Burke's street â€” five times</a>."
