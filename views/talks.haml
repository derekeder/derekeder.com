            I talked about the history of open government in Chicago, current landscape of our maturing civic tech community, the role of "Big Data" on public policy and the tools we must create to delineate this data. An interesting discussion of the bias of data or its visualizations led to an even more interesting discussion about the role of the designer within public policy.

            As of today the mid-term elections are only three months away. Between now and November 4th, campaigns will be frantically raising and spending as much money as they can. While candidates do need to disclose their spending this information isn't that easy to find, and it can be even harder to analyze. Well, that process got a little easier last week with the launch of <a href='http://electionmoney.org'>ElectionMoney.org</a>.
          %p
            The site collects information on candidates, contributions, spending and more, and makes it free to download. It’s intended for people who are serious about finding out information about campaign finance, especially journalists, researchers and analysts.
          %p
            Joining us to talk about the site are two of its creators, Derek Eder, owner of civic data company DataMade, and David Melton, Executive Director of the nonpartisan Illinois Campaign for Political Reform.

            This weekend, the Chicago area saw thunderstorms and nearly two inches of rain bringing flooding, power outages and the release of sewage into the Chicago River. It’s no secret that the city releases untreated waste and storm-water into the river, but now it’s easier to find out where and when its happening. One site looking into this is appropriately called IsThereSewageInTheChicagoRiver.com. Co-founder of civic hacking group Open City and one of the site's creators, Derek Eder, joins us with more.

            The public struggles of healthcare.gov have brought unusual attention to the process of how governments choose the companies who provide their technology. Is IT so specialized that the government needs to contract IT companies for their projects?

He's experienced firsthand the difficulty of working through the city's procurement process. Plus, Dan O'Neil, the executive director at Smart Chicago Collaborative and an organizer of the OpenGovChicago meetup, also joins us.

            Do you use data and statistics to show the impact your organization makes in our community? Finding and using data to narrate your organization’s story doesn’t have to be as overwhelming as it may seem. We’ll introduce you to methods that will help you collect useful documents and find meaning in your research. Then learn how Chicago journalists and data crunchers use data sets and public records to perform investigative journalism and how you can apply these same techniques in your own storytelling.
