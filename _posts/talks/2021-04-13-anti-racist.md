description: "What does it mean to be anti-racist? What is white supremacy culture and how does it show up? Over the past months, Chi Hack Nightâ€™s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) committee has discussed and researched these questions. I am joined by fellow Chi Hack Night Board Members Ryan Spencer and Samantha Evans to share what we learned in our blog post so that we can all work to make our communities more equitable and just."
