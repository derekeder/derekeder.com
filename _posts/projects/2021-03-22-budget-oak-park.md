description: "Budget: Oak Park is a budget transparency tool for the Village of Oak Park, Illinois. It was built by Oak Park Residents Derek Eder (Partner, DataMade) and Alicia Chastain. It is not an official application from the Village. By extracting data from the Villageâ€™s official budgets from 2017, 2019 and 2021, we were able to display and compare annual budgets from 2013 through 2021."
