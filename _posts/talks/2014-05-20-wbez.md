description: "This weekend, the Chicago area saw thunderstorms and nearly two inches of rain bringing flooding, power outages and the release of sewage into the Chicago River. It’s no secret that the city releases untreated waste and storm-water into the river, but now it’s easier to find out where and when its happening. One site looking into this is appropriately called IsThereSewageInTheChicagoRiver.com. Co-founder of civic hacking group Open City and one of the site's creators, Derek Eder, joins us with more."
