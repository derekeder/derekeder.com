        %strong Hi, I'm Derek Eder.
        I've been building websites in Chicago since 2005. During the day, I run <a href='http://datamade.us'>DataMade</a>, a civic technology company. We work on projects that make open data, make open source software, and make people more powerful. 
      %p
        Outside of that, I make civic apps with <a href='http://opencityapps.org'>Open City</a> and run the <a href='http://opengovhacknight.org'>Open Gov Hack Night</a>, Chicago's weekly event to build, share, and learn about civic tech. <a href='/about'>Read my full bio &raquo;</a>
