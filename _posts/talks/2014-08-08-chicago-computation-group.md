description: "<p>
        I gave a presentation to the Chicago Computation Group, a meetup of interdisciplinary design professionals practicing architecture, structural and mechanical engineering, environmental designers, and researchers from various fields advancing design thinking through the use of advanced computation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I talked about the history of open government in Chicago, current landscape of our maturing civic tech community, the role of 'Big Data' on public policy and the tools we must create to delineate this data. An interesting discussion of the bias of data or its visualizations led to an even more interesting discussion about the role of the designer within public policy.
