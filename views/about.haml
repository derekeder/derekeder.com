%h3 A bit more history
%p
  In 2011, I was working for a dev shop in Chicago called <a href='http://webitects.com'>Webitects</a> when the City's recently elected mayor decided to start releasing valuable data on their <a href='https://data.cityofchicago.org/'>Data Portal</a>. At the time, I already had an interest in government and technology, and had volunteered my tech skills to the Obama campaign in 2008, but this data gave me a way to engage with my government and community that was completely new.
%p
  A group of us at Webitects and Obtiva (another dev shop in Chicago) decided to take one of these newly released datasets on lobbyist disclosures and volunteered to creat our first 'civic app' called <a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/'>Chicago Lobbyists</a>. The app, which I like to describe as a 'Facebook for Lobbyists' allows you to see who the top paid lobbyists are, who's hiring them, and who they are lobbying. Through this app, this data was made accessible to average citizens (like ourselves) in a way that was easy to understand and delightful to interact with. The response from the City and local tech community was immediate and positive – they loved what we had done and started asking for us to build more apps.
%p
  At this point, I was hooked. I immediately started collaborating to build new apps with other available datasets – an app to <a href='http://chicagobuildings.org/'>track vacant and abandoned builldings</a>, an app to <a href='http://lookatcook.com/'>explore government budgets over time</a> and an app to <a href='http://clearstreets.org/'>track where snow plows go during a snowstorm</a>. I eventually found myself as a leader of a core group of volunteer developers and designers who all shared a common goal: to create apps with open data to improve transparency and understanding of our government. We knew we had a great thing going, so we decided to give it a name and call ourselves <a href='http://opencityapps.org/'>Open City</a>.
%p
  In order to better facilitate collaboration and get work done outside of our regular 9 to 5 jobs, we decided to meet every Tuesday at 6pm to work on our projects. This turned out to be an idea that appealed to a lot of people! What started out as four developers has now turned into 50-60 developers, designers, researchers, journalists, policy wonks and curious citizens who all want to work on or learn about open data and civic technology at an event we now call the <a href='http://opengovhacknight.org/'>Open Gov Hack Night</a>. 
%p
  Since my first civic app back in 2011, I have become a buisiness owner and a leader in the open government movement in Chicago. Our applications, approaches and culture have spread to cultural institutions like the Architechture Foundation via their <a href='http://bigdata.architecture.org/'>City of Big Data Exhibit</a>, to academia via programs like the <a href='http://dssg.io/'>The Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship</a>, to the <a href='http://www.socrata.com/case-study/chicago-growing-open-data-economy/'>private sector</a>, and especially <a href='http://techplan.cityofchicago.org/initiatives-by-strategy/effective-government/initiative-14/'>the City of Chicago itself</a>.
