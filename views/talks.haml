            Do you use data and statistics to show the impact your organization makes in our community? Finding and using data to narrate your organization’s story doesn’t have to be as overwhelming as it may seem. We’ll introduce you to methods that will help you collect useful documents and find meaning in your research. Then learn how Chicago journalists and data crunchers use data sets and public records to perform investigative journalism and how you can apply these same techniques in your own storytelling.
