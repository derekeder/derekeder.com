        To make Chicago’s zoning code digestible by humans, we took inspiration from one of our favorite games:
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000'>Sim City 2000</a>.
        Find out how your building is zoned, learn where to locate your business and explore zoning patterns throughout the city.
