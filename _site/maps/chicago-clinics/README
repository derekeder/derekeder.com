Fusion Table Searchable Map Template by Derek Eder
Version 1.1
Updated 10/2/2011

After receiving several requests for a walkthrough for creating searchable maps with Fusion Tables, I decided to create this template to help get people started. It includes the basic setup to display a fusion table map and do simple address and radius searches. Once you have this working, feel free to look at my other maps to see how I added the additional filters.
  	
Follow the steps below and you'll be in business with your own map
  	
1. Create a Fusion Table (http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home)
2. Make sure at least one column is set to a type of Location and that FT has geocoded it
3. Set the fusion table to be publicly visible (via the Share button in the upper right) 
4. In source/maps_lib.js, set fusionTableId to the ID of your Fusion Table (there's one at the bottom of index.html too)
5. In source/maps_lib.js, replace 'geometry' with the name of your location column
6. *Optional* Add additional search filters to the doSearch() function. This will depend on the data you are trying to map. I intentionally left these out to keep this example simple. You can see examples of these by viewing the source on any of these:

  - http://derekeder.com/maps/chicago-bike-crash-reports/index.html
  - http://derekeder.com/maps/chicago-tif/index.html
7. Upload this map and all the supporting files (source and styles folders) to your site
